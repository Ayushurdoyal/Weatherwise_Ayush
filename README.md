# WeatherWise â€“ Simple Weather Advisor

##Overview
WeatherWise is a natural-language weather advisor built in Python. It accepts everyday questions like:
 "Should I take an umbrella tomorrow in Brisbane?"
 "Will it be hot in Perth this weekend?"
 "Is it okay to wear sandals in Cairns tomorrow?"

This project was developed using iterative collaboration with AI tools (like ChatGPT), emphasizing code quality, prompting strategy, and real-world usefulness.

##Features
 Natural language input support
 City recognition (supports Australian cities)
 Context-aware response generation
 Conversational replies like a weather assistant

##AI Collaboration Strategy
 Used prompting to iteratively improve code clarity, flexibility, and edge case handling
 Conversations demonstrate error handling, UI enhancements, and AI feedback loops
 Includes before/after examples showing prompt impact

##How to Run
